# Employee Tracker

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. With this project I was able to create and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Instructions

To first start please do an npm install of all the dependencies. To start the project you would type 'node app.js'.
